# OOP
Object Oriented Programming with Ruby

Abstract personalcar.rb
In this program we can define two types of attributes. Personal name and surname attributes are cannot 
be change so we define it in as 'reader' type but age and degree situations we define in 'accessor' way because 
they changes after monthly or yealry. Same thing in car properties. Brand and car number do not 
but color and km attributes do.
